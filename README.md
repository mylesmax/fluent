Transform your learning experience with conversation.

## What is Fluent?

Fluent is a lightweight desktop application that revolutionizes how you learn. Based on [spaced-repetition](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5476736/), [active recall](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38461899/), and [Socratic methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4174386/), Fluent makes studying feel natural, engaging, and painlessly effective. Its aim is to help you learn **anything**, and ensure you never forget it, all while sharpening your ability to critically think in whichever domain you're studying.
